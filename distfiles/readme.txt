Colorful Critter
(c) 2017 fluffy @ beesbuzz.biz

HOW TO PLAY

Use a pointing device of your choice (mouse, Wacom tablet, touchscreen, etc.)
and color the critter!

You can choose a color by clicking on the color strip on the left, and you can
change the brush size by dragging the circle in the upper-right corner. The
little speaker icon in the corner toggles the sound.

If your pointing device supports it, you can also use the right mouse button (or
equivalent) as an "eyedropper" tool to pick up the color directly under the
cursor.

Have fun playing with the critter!
